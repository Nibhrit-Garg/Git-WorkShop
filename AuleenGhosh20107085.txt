Hey, I am Auleen Ghosh :)
I am a first-year undergrad in Mechanical Engineering.

I have a bit of prior knowledge of programming.
I learned a bit of C++ in my school.
After the JEE I started learning Python and also made a few small projects with the same.
Recently I also started to learn web development.

I look forward to learning about CyberSecurity and NetworkPenetration in the near future, because, frankly speaking,I am quite intrigued by these terms.

I also want to get started with OpenSourcing and Development as I have heard from my friends of senior batches from school that these fields are interesting to explore.

I hope that I get to learn a lot in ACM-CSS :‚Äù)
